# CPP
C++ research and Linked list datastructure


C++ library definitions, Standard library headers, and many notes for object oriented programming techniques for C++. All in PDF form for easy printing.

This is my quick reference for doing just about anything with C++.

I have included a [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) program I made while studying C++. This is the basis for most data structures and allowed me to test my skills in creating useful code. This linked list is generic and so can be used for any data type.

There is a menu incorporated into the linked list program for testing purposes.
